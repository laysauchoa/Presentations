### Iterate is fun, next!
 
Iterating is fun! Iteration is the act of going over a collection. We will understand how it works in Python and what is the difference between iterables and iterators. We will talk about iterator methods, such as iter() and next(), how to loop through iterables and iterators, and more. By the end of this talk, you will be surprised how easy and powerful iteration works in Python.
